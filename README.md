# WhatsForDinner

Randomly select dinner recipes for the coming week and create a shopping list of the items needed to make them.

Recipes are currently kept in .txt files in the src/recipes directory.

Entry point found in the src/controller directory

Very much a work in progress

Contributions are welcome, as long as they compile. Especially if you have any great recipes to add!!
